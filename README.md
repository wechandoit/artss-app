# Application for an Automated Robotic Tracheostomy Suctioning System

## Overview

This is a full-stack application, designed to be paired with the ARTSS prototype and efficiently control, manage, and schedule essential protocols involved with tracheostomy care in intensive care units.

The application consists of a backend API created with Flask and SQLAlchemy, and a frontend interface created with Vite, React, and TypeScript.

In order for this to run, go to the server folder and run: python3 app.py after installing the required pip dependencies, and run "npm run dev" in the client folder after installing the necessary npm dependencies.
